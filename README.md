• **Application Goal**

The aim of Haze is to create a sleek 
interface for messaging with certain comfort
feartures other messaging applications miss.

This app is built using WPF. All used libraries are internal

libraries it uses, so that I can include it in
my portfolio, and present it when necessary.
